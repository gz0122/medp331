                <h2>GRACE ZHU</h2>
                <p>I am a senior at Hunter College majoring in Statistics and minoring in Media Studies. Ever since my arrival at Hunter, I have changed my intended major at least 3 times. But everytime it always goes back to my love for art. This stems for my talent and skills with drawing when I was young. I always was the type of kid who had a pencil and paper in my hands trying to master bubble letter skills. Since, I got older, I strayed away from art to focus on my studies.<br><br>Then I got to know about illustrator in highschool and I was back to my usual self again. Making and creating art on illustrator was relieving my emotional stress. I also became more creative. I used to be stuck in my own bubble when it comes to making art. I only did what I was good at. With illustrator, it allowed me to explore and try different kinds of art. </p>
